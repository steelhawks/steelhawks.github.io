      "We are the subteam responsible for designing and creating a machine set to accomplish a task based on the game that comes out each year. We design and prototype beta robots before moving to the final design. Once we have each element of the robot finalized, we're responsible for putting it together in the most efficient way possible. We have to keep in mind factors such as drop centers, turning radius, height, speed, weight.",
