We developed curricula for the workshop and donated over $4,500 in supplies and resources, including a chassis and Iloilo’s first 3D printer. In the summer of 2017, Phyllis traveled to the Alimodian National Comprehensive HS and led a 4-week workshop teaching in  Tagalog. She taught teachers CAD and 3D printing. We held a schoolwide book drive which raised 2,500 books for these students and others across the three regions of the Philippines.',

Our team developed curricula for the engineering workshops she hosted at the Zilla Praja Parishth HS in Nellore. She taught the fundamentals of mechanical and electrical engineering, giving students the knowledge necessary to build a robot as well as how to code in Java and C++. For many, this was their first hands-on experience with technology in the classroom. Project India was recognized by the Government of Andhra Pradesh and catalyzed a discussion among local political leaders about including this type of career-applicable learning in their government schools.',

They have won multiple awards since their founding; their success prompted the William Floyd School District to fully fund 6 additional FLL and FLL Jr. teams.
