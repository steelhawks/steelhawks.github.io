      "Over the years, we’ve made it a priority to reach out to any and all teams that need help, whether it be in the form of mentorship or building space. Annually over the past five years we’ve created a full-scale replica of the game field and invite all FRC teams in the tri-state area to visit and practice alongside each other in the last weekend of the build season. Our build space is open to teams at any time throughout the Build Season, and we’ve helped many local FRC teams (5599, 3017, 6423, etc.) as well as international FRC teams (1156, 1382, and 1690).",
