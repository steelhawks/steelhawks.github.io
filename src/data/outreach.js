      'In the summer of 2017, one of our teammates, Phyllis Alinsao, traveled to Iloilo, Philippines to host hands-on engineering workshops; we called this program Project Philippines! Our team supported Phyllis by donating over $4,500 of materials, including tools and a chassis so that the students could receive a hands-on engineering experience. We also worked with Phyllis to create the curriculum for the four-week workshops. After Phyllis returned, she told us that Iloilo and surrounding neighborhoods had no libraries; In response, we held a schoolwide book drive for these students and others across the three regions of the Philippines: Mindanao, Luzon, and the Western Visayas.',

      'In 2019, our teammate, Neeharika Kotimreddy, traveled to her hometown of Muthukur in Nellore, India to host Project India. Our team developed curricula for the engineering workshops she hosted at the Zilla Praja Parishth HS in Nellore. She taught the fundamentals of mechanical and electrical engineering giving students the knowledge necessary to build a robot. Her students also learned to code in Java and C++, enabling them to control their robot, their first hands-on experience with technology in the classroom. Project India was recognized by the Government of Andhra Pradesh and catalyzed a discussion among local political leaders about including this type of career-applicable learning in their government schools.',

      'Our former Vice President, Daniel Sotelo-Reiner, had a vision which came to fruition in 2017. He was inspired by our team\'s inclusivity to create a film to embody what we stand for. “FIRST® Relations” is the result of his efforts. His film debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2018. Daniel wrote, produced, and edited "FIRST® Relations" with the help of 30 members from our teams. His passion for our team and for filmmaking introduced the film community to FIRST. The main character in his film is a member of the LGBTQ+ community and the entire cast is ethnically diverse. His film emphasizes our team’s belief that FIRST and the STEM fields as a whole are open to everyone, regardless of economic status, religion, race, or sexual orientation.',

Annually over the past five years we’ve created a full-scale replica of the game field and invite all FRC teams in the tri-state area to visit and practice alongside each other in the last weekend of the build season. Our build space is open to teams at any time throughout the Build Season, and we’ve helped many local FRC teams (5599, 3017, 6423, etc.) as well as international FRC teams (1156, 1382, and 1690).',

Here, we sparked the students interest in robotics and the STEM community by letting the students operate and drive our robot so they can gain a hands-on experience. We also give presentations detailing the valuable skills and capabilities FIRST can foster in them. The students of William Floyd went on to start Team 23094 and sparked interest within their school district, who later founded the start of seven other FIRST Lego League (FLL) teams.',

We look forward to seeing childrens’ faces light up when they help us control our robot. Sharing our stories motivates parents to get their children involved in robotics. Our visits to Solomon Schechter Manhattan, have resulted in a K-8 STEAM program that includes a MakerSpace and a coding curriculum that starts in kindergarten.',
